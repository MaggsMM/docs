To cater to all types of data you might want to gather, there are multiple form types. For example, if you want to report a bug, You might want a user to enter a summary (short text input form field), describe a bug (long text input form field), select if the bug happened on mobile or desktop (radio form field), and possibly upload a screenshot (image upload form field). 

This would be what the user sees when they fill in such a workflow instance:

        ""
      ],

    }
  ]
}

## Form configuration

You can work with form field configuration when you click on a step and add a form field.

        null,
        ""
      ],
      "align": "center"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


To configure form fields, do the following:

1. Go to **Workflows > Edit workflow**. 
2. Click **Add step**. 
3. Select **Form**. 
4. Click **Add form field**. 
5. Click the settings icon to add placeholders for fields or labels (step titles), and make the step optional.

> üëç **Tip:** By default form fields are required. If you want a field to be optional, you need to select **Optional** in the **Settings**.

There are also options to copy the form field ID, copy the form, move it (for example to a different step), and delete it. 

Setting form conditions works in the same way as step conditions. For details, see [Set conditions to a step](/docs/set-conditions-to-a-step)

## Edit a form field

After you've completed a form, you can still edit the fields if you're an admin or a user assigned to the step or if the step has been delegated to you. 

If you go to the step (by following a link in the email), you can click the pencil icon, update your field data, and save your changes. 

Notes:

- You can edit the step as long as the workflow hasn't been completed.
- If there are conditions related to the step or any other dependencies that have already been completed, updating the field doesn't change them.
- You can't update the completed step using the API.
